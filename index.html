  <section class="about">
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      At Little Stars Babysitting, we’re built on years of genuine childcare experience. Our founder spent four wonderful years as a registered childminder, caring for little ones in a nurturing, safe, and homely environment.

Although she took a short break from childminding, her passion for working with children never faded. That love for childcare and helping families is what inspired the idea for Little Stars.

We understand how important it is to find someone you can truly trust with your child, and we’re here to offer care that feels like family.
